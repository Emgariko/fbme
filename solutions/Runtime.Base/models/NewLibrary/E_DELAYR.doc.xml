    <strong>Temporal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>When 'START' is triggered just one delayed Event at 'EO' will be actuated. The delay-time can be defined at input 'DT'.</p>
<p>If a 'RESTART' signal comes in, before the last started Event at 'EO' could be fired, the delay time for the Event starts new. A second 'START' signal that comes in before the 'EO' is fired will be ignored.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Temporal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>When a 'START'-Event is detected, the value of the 'DT'-input is captured and a delay-timer is started. When the timer expires then the 'EO'-Event is fired. The timer is NOT restarted automatically. The timer may be restarted by a 'RESTART'-Event or by applying a new 'START'-Event. In both cases the 'DT'-input value will be captured and applied for the new delay time.</p>
<p>In the case when a delay-timer is already active and a new 'START'-Event is applied then the event will be ignored. But a 'RESTART'-Event cancels the current delay-timer and restarts it with the initial value captured at the 'DT'-input.</p>
<p>The timer remains active until a 'STOP'-Event is detected. A 'STOP'-Event will be ignored when no timer is active.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Functional Behavior</strong></p>
<p>The 'DT'-input value is interpreted as the IEC-TIME duration format.</p>
<p>If the 'DT'-input is set to zero then the 'START'-Event is immediately passed through to the 'EO'-Event output within a minimum internal delay.</p></wysiwyg></section>
