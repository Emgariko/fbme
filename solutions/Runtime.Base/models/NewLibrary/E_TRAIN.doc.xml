    <strong>Temporal Behavior</strong> </p><p>The number of events is defined by the 'N'-input and the time interval between the output events is given by the 'DT'-input.</p><p>When a 'START'-Event is detected, the values of the 'N'-input and the 'DT'-input are read, then 'N' output events at 'EO' are generated with an interval defined by the 'DT'-input. The 'CV'-output is updated at every event with the event index which starts at the value '0'.</p><p>The event generation can be stopped by the 'STOP-Event input. A 'STOP'-Event is ignored when there was no 'START'-Event before.</p><p>A subsequent 'START'-Event can then trigger a new train of output events. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Functional Behavior</strong></p><p>'DT'-input: format is IEC-TIME duration, for example: "t#100ms".</p><p>'N'-input: defines the number of events to be created.</p><p> </p><p>
